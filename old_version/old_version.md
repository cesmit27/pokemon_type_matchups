This file is the original version of this "project". I made it when I was starting out learning python and wanted to familiarize myself with Arrays, Dictionaires, Loops, etc. I have been a Pok√©mon fan for around 15 years at this point, so I figured this would be not only a good learning opportunity but one that would also be fun and useful for me. In any case, this script is not very advanced as it just runs in the command line. It also had some issues with how I had all the different forms in different dictionaries, something that is no longer the case in the new version. I just wanted to leave this here for my reference and for anyone who doesn't want to deal with installing an .exe file.
