#name_cleaner
I pulled the types of each pokemon from Bulbapedia. However, just copying and pasting them wouldn't work, as I wanted to add each pokemon to a list in python. 
So this code helped clean the text I copied from Bulbapedia in order to have it be formatted correctly to be put in a list.
A reference image from Bulbapedia is included so you can understand what the text originally looks like.
