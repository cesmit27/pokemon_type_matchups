# Pokémon Type Matchups
Tool to determine the type matchups in the Pokémon games. Up to date with all Pokémon through Generation 9, including DLC Pokémon.


I have now updated it to have a GUI instead of running through the command line! I have included the new code as well as an exe file for anyone to download. The old version has been moved to the folder "old_version".
