UPDATE!!!! 


I changed how I wanted to design this tool, so this code is no longer useful, but I am keeping it in this directory just because it could be useful for me to look back at in the future.



I pulled the types of each pokemon from Bulbapedia. However, just copying and pasting them wouldn't work, as I wanted to add each pokemon to a list in python. 
So this code helped clean the text I copied from Bulbapedia in order to have it be formatted correctly to be put in a list.
A reference image from Bulbapedia is also included so you can understand what the text originally looks like.
